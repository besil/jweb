# JWeb

JWeb is a framework for developing and testing easily rest services.
It is built around [Spark](http://sparkjava.com/),
according with the [Spark testing guide](https://sparktutorials.github.io/2015/07/30/spark-testing-unit.html)

The framework aims to be a library with support for common funcionalities
(such as pojo request mapping, session management, ...),
similarly to Django or other common web frameworks.

### Features
In addition to giving a standard structure to your server code,
_jweb_ includes various out-of-the-box apps, such as:

1. **RestDocsApp**: automatic REST Schema generator for your endpoints

2. **DynamicContentApp**: switching from HTML or JSON output dinamically

3. **SessionManagerApp**: session manager app

You can find examples [here](https://github.com/besil/jwebsample).

Other apps will come, as the project evolves. Contributions are very appreciated
